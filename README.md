This project is used for reworking my blog, here are what I did for my blog:

Creating my blog by pelican with a default theme.  
It was deployed on github:  
**https://dtysky.github.io**(It dosn't work now.)

### 2014.06

Changing the theme... emm, as you known, my aesthetics at that time, so... 

### 2015.02

With the improved level of aesthetic quality, I  changed the theme again with using javascript and css animation, that theme is very close to it now.  
At the same time, I registered domains **dtysky.moe** and move the site to a DO VPS.

### 2016.02

I changed my career from FPGA enginner to software enginner(web).  
Emm...one day, I find a music player is needed so that i need make my blog from static to dynamic.  
That's the reason why i does these.
