## Description

Reworke my blog with react, flask, mongodb...here are what I did for my blog:  

### 2014.05

Create my blog with [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) with a default theme.  
It was deployed on github:  
**https://dtysky.github.io**(It dosn't work now.)

### 2014.06

Change the theme... emm, my aesthetics at that time, so... 

### 2015.02

With the improved level of aesthetic quality, I  changed the theme again with javascript and css animation, that theme is very close to it now.  
At the same time, I registered domains **dtysky.moe** and move the site to a VPS on DigitalOcean.  
This version is here now:  
[old.dtysky.moe](http://old.dtysky.moe)

### 2016.02

I changed my career from FPGA enginner to software enginner(web).  
Emm...one day, I felt a music player is necessary so that I need change my blog from static to dynamic.  
That's the reason why I do these.  

## To(Never www)Do list

### Adding cache on server

One record will be added to cache while the server recives a request first time.  
All records in cache will be cleared when database is updated.

### Using redux and ES7 to rework "Front" again

Well, this blog is not friendly with search enginner now(although I used react-router server side rendering and fragment meta tag now), for resolving this problem, I must use another framework to make the data sync between the server and client.  
Why using ES7?  
ES5... I can't writing clean code with it... 

## Front

### Finish

Most of these use  inheritance and reflection  so that I can add any new function easily.

**Parser:**  
File parsers and slug(URL) warppers.  

**Feeds and sitemap generator:**

[Database desigin](https://github.com/dtysky/BlogRework/blob/master/Back/Database.md)  

**File state monitor:**  
Monitoring state of pages , if there are files changed, it will check database and call parsers, warppers and database writers to update database.  

**Logger:**  
A logger for recording infomations, errors and warnings.  

## Others

Forever.js is used for starting all servers as daemons. 

## How to use?  

**Back:**  
Edit the "config.py" then run the "main.py".  

**Front:**  
Edit the "config.json" then:  
1. "grunt client-build" will build the client code  
2. "grunt server-build" will build the server code  
3. "grunt build" will build client and server all  
4. "grunt debug" will open the port 8000 for development
